### Headphone Jack fix
run alc-verb 0x19 0x707 0x24 ever time boot.
or use install-alc-verb-fix.sh.

### Keyboard & Remaps
* F1 prev
* F2 play
* F3 next
* F4 Spotlight
* ChrOS search (caps lock position) -> left command
* Globe key  -> caps
PS: ChrOS search is command by default and seems not changable. you can try to change it by edit drallion-keymap.dsl.

## Note
* OpenIntelWireless should be replaced for different macOS version.
* Better not to change KEXT order.
* You have to replace MLB, SN, UUID in config.plist.
* ~~Do NOT update VoodooI2C VoodooI2CELAN VoodooI2CHID cause it's patched version.~~
* After boot you may see black screen, just turn off and turn on lid, or use SSDT-REG-LID0.aml. HDMI may not work or act strange, try to plug in twice HDMI cable or reboot.

## Maybe just for myself
* HDMI won't work on cold start, need reboot. You can press CTRL + ALT + DEL immediately after you see the boot logo (rabbit) to quickly get in warm start.
* Normally it will sleep immediately after boot, It's ok, just close and reopen the lid. And HDMI works.
* It will not sleep immediately after boot on cold start (HDMI won't work).
* You may need to plug in HDMI cable twice.
